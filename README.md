# Java SQL Question Bank System

## üìö Overview

This is a **Java-based Question Bank Management System** that utilizes **MySQL** for backend data storage. It supports both **Admin** and **User** roles, allowing admins to manage questions and users to take randomized quizzes across multiple subjects.

Developed as a **final project** for academic purposes using **NetBeans**, **Java Swing**, and **JDBC**, this project demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, GUI design, and database connectivity.

## üìù How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Import it into **NetBeans IDE**.
3. Set up a MySQL server with the database schema (included in `/sql/schema.sql`).
4. Modify the `DB_Connection` class to match your local MySQL credentials.
5. Run the project.

## üöß Known Limitations

- The **Edit** feature is not yet fully implemented.
- Questions are selected randomly using `ORDER BY RAND()` ‚Äî this can cause repetition.
- Sign-Up is handled via `JOptionPane`; should be replaced with a proper form in future updates.
- Passwords are stored as plaintext ‚Äî security improvements are required for production use.

## üìå Future Improvements

- Add quiz scoring and progress tracking
- Implement paginated question loading
- Secure password hashing and user validation
- Improve UI/UX with cleaner layouts and confirmations
- Unit test coverage and error logging
